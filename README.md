# Hassaan's Recipes

The goal of this project was to develop a simple website featuring a selection of my favourite recipes. Some fun facts:

- This project marks the commencement of my journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "The Odin Project")
- My primary focus was on acquiring practical experience with HTML
- I find myself intrigued by Git and Github, so I wanted to begin committing straight away and after some reading decided to adopt [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ "Conventional Commits"). I hope to revisit my commit history in the near future to reflect, this time as a seasoned Git user :smile:
